Creating an Airline Database involves designing various tables to represent entities like flights, passengers, aircraft, pilots, and bookings. Below is a conceptual design for such a database with SQL DDL statements to create the tables and establish their relationships.

### Entities and Their Relationships:

1. **Flights**: Details about each flight.
2. **Aircraft**: Information about aircraft.
3. **Pilots**: Information about pilots.
4. **Passengers**: Details of passengers.
5. **Bookings**: Records of flight bookings by passengers.
6. **FlightCrew**: Assigning crew to flights.

The relationships between these entities can be defined as follows:
- A flight is associated with one aircraft and one or more pilots.
- Passengers make bookings for flights.
- A flight crew is assigned to each flight.

### SQL Statements to Create Tables:

1. **Aircraft Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Aircraft (
       AircraftID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
       Model NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       Capacity INT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

2. **Pilots Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Pilots (
       PilotID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
       Name NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       LicenseNumber NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       Rank NVARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

3. **Flights Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Flights (
       FlightID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
       DepartureTime DATETIME NOT NULL,
       ArrivalTime DATETIME NOT NULL,
       Origin NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       Destination NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       AircraftID INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (AircraftID) REFERENCES Aircraft(AircraftID)
   );
   ```

4. **Passengers Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Passengers (
       PassengerID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
       FirstName NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       LastName NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       PassportNumber NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

5. **Bookings Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Bookings (
       BookingID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
       FlightID INT NOT NULL,
       PassengerID INT NOT NULL,
       BookingDate DATETIME NOT NULL,
       SeatNumber NVARCHAR(10),
       FOREIGN KEY (FlightID) REFERENCES Flights(FlightID),
       FOREIGN KEY (PassengerID) REFERENCES Passengers(PassengerID)
   );
   ```

6. **FlightCrew Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE FlightCrew (
       FlightCrewID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
       FlightID INT NOT NULL,
       PilotID INT NOT NULL,
       Role NVARCHAR(50),
       FOREIGN KEY (FlightID) REFERENCES Flights(FlightID),
       FOREIGN KEY (PilotID) REFERENCES Pilots(PilotID)
   );
   ```

### Additional Considerations:

- **Indexes**: Consider adding indexes on frequently searched columns like FlightID in Bookings and Flights tables for faster query performance.
- **Constraints and Validations**: Additional constraints (like CHECK constraints for valid dates, times, and seat numbers) can be added to ensure data integrity.
- **Normalization**: The design can be further normalized if necessary to reduce redundancy.
- **Data Types and Sizes**: Adjust the data types and sizes according to your specific data requirements.
- **Additional Entities**: Depending on the requirements, you might also need tables for airports, flight schedules, ticket prices, etc.

This schema provides a foundational structure for an airline database. You can expand or modify it based on the specific needs and business rules of the airline system you are designing.
